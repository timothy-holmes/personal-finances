# personal-finances

I'm building a personal, personal finances app for use in the Homburg-Holmes home.

MVP will consist of near real-time graphs and tables used to make family finance easier. Future features will include: ability to quickly categorise transactions presenting uncategorised, forecast and communicate cash flows based on past expenses and incomes, insight into specific expenses (utilities, groceries, eating out)

To be achieved using:
- AWS Transact, Lambda
- Swagger for API interaction
- machine learning integration eg. random forest, XGBoost
- Up API webhooks
- Node.js
